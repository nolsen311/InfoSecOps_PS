# Introduction 
A collection of useful powershell scripts to load functions and provide simple access to operational powershell
**not _everything_ is necessarily complete, you _may_ have to modify things to make them work properly in your environment**
most things should be working fairly well.

# Getting Started
You may want to start using PowerShell Core. It's available cross-platform and is super useful. There are a couple functions that require PSCore, but they'll let you know.  
The install script will put a reference to this directory in your powershell profile and then set up importing all these modules when you open a new window.  

1.	```git clone PS_functions```
2.  ```cd PS_functions```
2.	```./install.ps1```
